This is a user registration project. This app is backend API based means only accessible with correct url paths (For Example : 127.1.8000/register/).
every function to be used requires the same as mentioned above.
Now, for using login or reset password APIs user needs to add the respective paths mentioned in urls.py of app 
This whole project's database is based on sql lite.
There is no frontend as this waas a backend project to showcase the authentication form.
I tried my best. Thank you.
